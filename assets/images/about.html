   <h1>About Me</h1>
   <p>Hi, I'm Ayoub Rached, a passionate and motivated computer science student at the New Jersey Institute of Technology, set to graduate in May 2025. I have a solid foundation in various programming languages, including Python, Java, and C/C++, and hands-on experience with web development and database management.<br><br>

    I’m AWS Cloud Practitioner certified and have worked on several projects, such as MarketMatch, a retail price analyzer, and machine learning models for salary prediction. My expertise includes analyzing data, developing clean, efficient code, and building user-friendly web applications. I’ve also gained valuable experience as an independent contractor, where I evaluated and tested code solutions for large-scale models.
    
    Currently, I'm exploring opportunities in software development and cloud computing, with a focus on full-stack development and data science.</p>
